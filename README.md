## 🎯 What Does It Do?

Ever wondered "When will this video actually end?" or "How long until I finish this playlist?" **YouTube Time Manager** answers these questions and more with style. It's your personal YouTube assistant that helps you:

- 📊 **Track Time Like a Pro**: See exactly when your video, chapter, or entire playlist will finish
- ⚡ **Speed Control Mastery**: One-click speed changes with beautiful interactive rows
- 🎯 **Custom Targets**: Set specific finish times or durations - "I need to be done by 3 PM!"
- ☕ **Ad Break Entertainment**: Enjoy a relaxing coffee animation while ads play (because ads fund free content!)
- 🎨 **Personalize Everything**: Toggle cards, choose themes, customize your dashboard

Think of it as a **fitness tracker for your YouTube habits**, but way more stylish.

## � Known Issues & Limitations

### The "Not Really Issues" Issues
1. **YouTube Changes Layout**: YouTube updates their site often. We adapt, but there might be 24h where things look wonky.
2. **Livestreams**: Time estimation on live content is... creative. We're working on it!
3. **Ad Blocker Conflicts**: If you block ads, the ad card won't show. That's... expected?

### Actual Limitations
- Chapter detection depends on YouTube's page structure
- Playlist calculations assume linear watching
- Time estimates don't account for buffering (we're not psychic)
